# Stardew Valley mods by voltaek

This repository contains most, if not all, of my mods for Stardew Valley.
While most releases are tagged here, they are always made available for
download - along with full descriptions - on [Nexus Mods](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/voltaek/mods).

## [Honey Harvest Predictor](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/20493)

( [Source](HoneyHarvestPredictor)
| [Changelog](HoneyHarvestPredictor/CHANGELOG.md)
| [API](HoneyHarvestPredictor/API) )

This mod syncs the icon shown in the bubble above ready-for-harvest bee houses with the what you'll harvest from it.
You can either have it show you the flower that will flavor the honey or the honey bottle you'll receive
(if you have another mod that applies custom honey bottle icons).

## [Colored Honey Labels](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/30945)

( [Source](ColoredHoneyLabels)
| [Changelog](ColoredHoneyLabels/CHANGELOG.md)
| [Integration Docs](ColoredHoneyLabels/README.md)
| [Example Asset Override Mod](ColoredHoneyLabels/ExampleAssetOverrideMod) )

Colors honey bottle labels automatically by honey type.
Other mods may easily provide their own custom texture for the custom honey bottle texture asset (see docs and example mod).
